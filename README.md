WIP

Code for the tracking of microtubles

Two methods:
1) Manual tracking (WIP)\
  a) Use preprocessing.py in the folder nn to preprocess the images\
  b) Then, track using track_images.py\
  c) Currently working, can display video file of tracked points\
2) 
3) Hybrid CNN and RNN neural network (nn.py) (WIP, barely works as of right now)
